# Snaptail python edition

[Snaptail](https://github.com/rybarix/snaptail) is a tool that allows you to run a local development server for a React project, and automatically reload the browser when the server restarts.

The original version is written in node and allows single file application development in React. This is a python version that allows running React frontend in one file and python backend in another file.

This is alpha software and there is no runnable pip package yet.
